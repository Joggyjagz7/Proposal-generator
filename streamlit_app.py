with st.sidebar: 
    """  A proposal letter is a formal document that is written to present a specific idea, project, product, or service to a potential client, partner, investor, or organization. It serves as an introduction and provides a summary of the proposed concept, highlighting its benefits, objectives, and value proposition.

A well-crafted proposal letter aims to persuade the recipient to consider the proposal and take further action, such as scheduling a meeting, providing funding, entering into a partnership, or accepting a business proposal.

Here are some key components typically included in a proposal letter:

Sender's Information: The letter should begin with the sender's contact information, including their name, title, company name, address, phone number, and email address.

Date: The date when the letter is written.

Recipient's Information: The letter should include the recipient's name, title, company name, and address. If possible, address the letter to a specific person rather than using a generic salutation.

Salutation: A formal greeting, such as "Dear Mr./Ms. [Recipient's Last Name],"

Introduction: Begin the letter by introducing yourself and your company. Provide a brief overview of your background and establish credibility.

Purpose: Clearly state the purpose of the letter and the proposal you are presenting. Explain the problem or opportunity you have identified and how your proposal can address it.

Proposal Details: Provide a comprehensive description of your proposal, including the key features, benefits, and advantages it offers. Use persuasive language and supporting evidence to make your case.

Implementation Plan: Outline the steps and timeline for implementing the proposal. Explain how the recipient will benefit from your proposal and any specific actions required from their end.

Call to Action: Clearly state the desired next steps or actions you want the recipient to take, such as scheduling a meeting, requesting additional information, or providing feedback.

Closing: Thank the recipient for their time and consideration. Include your contact information once again and express your willingness to answer any questions or provide further details.

Sincerely: End the letter with a formal closing, such as "Sincerely" or "Best regards," followed by your name and signature.

A well-written proposal letter should be concise, persuasive, and tailored to the recipient's needs and interests. It should highlight the value and uniqueness of your proposal while addressing any potential concerns or objections.
